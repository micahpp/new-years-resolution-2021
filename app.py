This works out to roughly 30 a day

I used the [Streaks app](https://streaksapp.com/) to remind me to do them daily. 
One of the nice things about the app is that you can set how many times a day you want to do a task.
This made it easy for me to do and track more push-ups in blocks of 30

I kept track of my progress in a spreadhseet. Below is some analysis on the numbers
